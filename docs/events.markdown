useEffect(() => {
  const onStopListener = BleManager.onStopScan((args) => {
    // Scanning is stopped args.status
  });

  return () => {
    onStopListener.remove();
  };
    
}, []);
```

The scanning for peripherals is ended.

**Arguments**

- `status` - `Number` - [iOS] the reason for stopping the scan. Error code 10 is used for timeouts, 0 covers everything else. [Android] the reason for stopping the scan (<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/le/ScanCallback#constants_1>). Error code 10 is used for timeouts

### onDidUpdateState

The BLE state changed.

**Arguments**

- `state` - `String` - the new BLE state. Can be one of `unknown` (iOS only), `resetting` (iOS only), `unsupported`, `unauthorized` (iOS only), `on`, `off`, `turning_on` (android only), `turning_off` (android only).

### onDiscoverPeripheral

The scanning found a new peripheral.

**Arguments**

- `id` - `String` - the id of the peripheral
- `name` - `String` - the name of the peripheral
- `rssi` - `Number` - the RSSI value
- `advertising` - `JSON` - the advertising payload, here are some examples:
